# ADS506FinalProject
As we know Quebec has cold and long winters and the weather is a possible parameter that could have a direct impact on car sales.
The main goal is to forecast car sales for the next 5 to 10 years based on seasonal conditions.
This is a time-series forecast, the dataset has two columns with the time column and the number of sales column. The data set contains car sales data from January of 1960 to December 1968 in Quebec, Canada. This data was accumulated monthly and already been cleaned by the data source. The data was obtained from: Monthly Car Sales in Quebec 1960 | Kaggle. There are 108 observations (1960-1968) 12 observations per year for 9 years from 1960 to 1968.
The models used are Naive, Seasonal Naive, Regression with season and trend as predictors, exponential smoothing, moving average, and ARIMA

The project was created to satisfy the requirements of a graduate-level course in Practical Data Engineering. The collaborators are:
